       <p>All About Photo invites dedicated and passionate photographers from all around the world to share their work in its printed edition. Each issue is central to a specific theme and provides a gallery of inspiring imagery, focusing on each artist with their own experience to share.
We are honored to be a part of the process of jurying work from such an amazing call for entry and to be able to design such a beautiful, hand-curated publication of the best contemporary photography. We showcase exclusively the winners of AAP Magazine's call of entries organized by All About Photo all year long.
With an eye towards beauty, quality and novelty, we strive to promote portfolios which stand out for their unique visual signature style and character. Our goal is to help photographers get the exposure we think they deserve and to inspire the others with ideas, projects and goals to help develop their own photography.
